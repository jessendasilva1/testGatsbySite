Typography.js: 
    Helps generate CSS for block and inline elements. Set default values for them and change one value
    to change all elemnts that follow the typography

Source Plugins: 
    Bring in data to your gatsby website

Transformer Plugins: 
    Takes raw content from source plugins and transforms it into something useful. (Source plugins get the file info, but 
    not the actual content of the files)

Slug: 
    generate a path for the page (also known as a slug for a page). Programmatically creates pages for each of your nodes(data objects)
    returned from your graphql query. Once the slugs for each page have been created, you can then actually create the pages.
